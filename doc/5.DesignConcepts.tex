\section{Design concepts}

``... with proper design, the features come cheaply. This approach is
arduous, but continues to succeed.''

\huge{This is a draft of the design concepts}

Objects:

\begin{description}
    \item[Paquito] orchestrator
    \item[Packet] packet representation
    \item[Host] host representation
    \item[Link] link representation
\end{description}

Hosts try to send until it have packet to send.
Hosts notify link that there are sensing. Then when sensing time is elapsed,
orchestrator will call the send method. If the boolean saying that the
link is idle have not been set to false the packet is sent.
If the link was not idle, a new sense request is sent to the link and so
on.
Every time a host is sending a packet, for each host on the link between
sender and receiver, the link will be set to in use when the signal is
under the adaptor and reset to idle when the packet is transmitted.
If a host try to send a packet will another one is sending a jam signal
is sent to all the host and all the packet, traffic notification and
sensing are discarded. Host will wait a random time between 0 and 2 pow
K with K incrementing by one each consecutive jam signal until 15. When a
host successfully send a packet, K is reset to 0.
