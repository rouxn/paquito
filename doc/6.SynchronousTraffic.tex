\section{Synchronous traffic}

TODO: Introduce synchronous traffic.

Packet arrival and inter arrival time are all uniform and deterministic.

\begin{description}
    \item Arrival process : packet size / bandwidth ( packets/sec)
    \item Traffic load = packet arrival time rate * packet size
    \item Average packet delay = transmission time for one packet
    \item Delay Variance = 0 because intervals are equal.
    \item Thoughput = $\frac{number of byte sent}{total time}$
\end{description}

TODO: Explain constant bit rate
